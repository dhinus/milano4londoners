# Where to eat (and drink)

- **Pavè**. A simple coffee place with outstanding home-made cakes and croissants.
  Great service, no better way to begin your day. Crowded on weekends.

- **Eataly**. Think Whole Foods, but _much_ better. Organic food market plus a
  dozen small eating areas with different menus (“Ristorantini”) offering
  freshly cooked food at very reasonable prices.

- **Piccola Ischia**. A constant in every list of best Pizzerias in Milan, they
  have four restaurants and they're also amazingly cheap. Service is a bit rough
  but pizzas are really great.

- **Santeria**. Hipster-friendly bar with art gallery, co-working space and
  great cocktails. Perfect for a drink before dinner, or stay there for one of
  their burgers. Great brunches on Sunday.

- **Blu**. Restaurant/Bar with nice atmosphere and friendly service. It’s open from
  breakfast (with great croissants from a local bakery) to lunch, pre-dinner
  cocktails and wines, dinner and after-dinner drinks. The cocktail and wine
  selection is top-notch, while the food is good but slightly overpriced.

- **Lacerba**. Cocktail Bar + Restaurant (there are two separate entrances, look
  carefully). Possibly the best and most creative cocktails in Milan. Never been
  to the restaurant but I've heard it's mostly about fish and quite expensive. The
  cocktails instead are less than 10 euros each and they give you some appetizers
  for free. They’re open until late and on some nights they have DJs too.

- **Birrificio di Lambrate**. Microbrewery with small Irish-style pub. One of the
  very few good pubs in Milan. If you want a pint, that's your place. They only
  serve their own beers and there’s a small but decent food menu as well.

- **Grom**. If it's sunny, and you want an ice cream, this is the place I would go
  to. It's a chain and some snobs are complaining it's not indie enough but
  ignore them, their gelato is consistently great. Try the whipped cream on top as
  well. :)
